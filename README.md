This is an art-guided project I made based the fantastic video of Harajuku in Shibuya, Tokyo. The video is shot in October, 1990.
You can find the video on the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5oAqmqdSas "Harajuku, 1990"). Thanks for the guy who shoted
this and the one who uploaded this to the Internet.

I try to use the classic Grabcut algorithom to get the people in this video. Most of them look quite strange in today's view as 
they are in fact about 30 years older now. It is quite amazing to see these fashion "young people", who are in fact as old as my parents.
Indeed, the fashion seems a circle and something never changes regradeless of time. 

Below are some examples of my results. More can be found in the 'result' file.
